"Sea and Us" – A tender moment captured during a couple's journey in Pattaya City, where the sky melts into soft pastels at sunset. The painting shows the joy of love and togetherness, as the couple holds hands, smiling warmly against the backdrop of a peaceful beach. The simplicity of the lines and colors emphasizes the sincerity of the moment – a memory made by the sea, held forever in each other’s hearts.

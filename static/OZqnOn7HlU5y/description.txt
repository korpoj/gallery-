"Second Date at Arabica" is a quiet tribute to a simple, beautiful moment — two cups on a table, side by side. One is a creamy matcha latte, the other a café latte. The setting is Arabica, a cozy little coffee shop where time seemed to slow, just for us.

It was our second date. Still new, still learning each other’s rhythms. With the soft aroma of coffee and matcha in the air, everything felt easy. Natural.

This painting isn't just about drinks. It’s about a connection growing — one sip, one smile, one quiet moment at a time.

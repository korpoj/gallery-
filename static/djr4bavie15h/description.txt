"Our First Dinner" captures a cherished memory, frozen in brushstrokes and colour — the moment my lover and I shared our very first meal together. It was at Katsushin, a quiet little place filled with the soft clatter of dishes and the warm hum of conversation.

The painting holds more than just the setting; it holds a feeling — the gentle nervousness, the shy glances, the spark of something new. Every stroke whispers of that night: the subtle glow of the lights, the steam rising from the food, the way time seemed to pause as we laughed and talked like old souls just meeting again.

This isn’t just a painting. It’s a memory — intimate, vivid, and forever etched in colour.
